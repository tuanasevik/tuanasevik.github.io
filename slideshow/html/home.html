            <p>Hello! My name is Tuana Sevik and this site is about a project I did earlier this semester. I had detail
                or macro photography as theme.</p>
            <p>On the two other sites, you'll see a slideshow which contains 5 of my pictures, and a video which
                contains most of the photos I made.</p>

            <br><h3>Here are some general infos on macro photography:</h3>
            <p>
                Macro photography is about capturing a small subject at enormous magnification—that is, an extreme
                close-up of something small.

                A full frame 13x18 insect or a 10 centimeter product photo of a breakfast cereal are examples of macro
                photography. (One could also use this definition for photographing through a microscope.
                However, this is summarized under the term microphotography, i.e. photos of microscopically small
                things.)
            </p>
            <p>
                In macro photography you leave the world as you know it and discover a new one.

                "A good place to start is in your fridge," advises Long. “Berries are fascinating when you look at them
                up close. You can see impressive structures - you can even find hair on them. I photographed a breakfast
                cereal at insane magnification and it looked like either a pretty gross piece of meat or like the
                surface of Mars.”

                As with all photographic genres, you should experiment to find what you're looking for in your photos.
                The deeper you dive into this new, enigmatic world, the more you realize what you want to show.
